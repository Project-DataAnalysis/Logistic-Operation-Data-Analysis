# 🚚 Logistic Sales Data Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Brief One Line Summary  
An interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor logistics operations, shipment performance, and weather impacts across locations.

## 📝 Overview  
This project presents an end-to-end Power BI solution for analyzing logistics and transportation data. It tracks shipment volumes, delivery performance, utilization of assets, and environmental factors like temperature and humidity. The dashboard empowers stakeholders to optimize operations and reduce delays.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Logistics managers require a consolidated view of shipment statuses, on-time delivery performance, asset utilization, and external factors (like weather) to ensure timely deliveries and effective resource planning. This dashboard addresses that need.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes transactional and operational data with the following attributes:
- Shipment volumes, status (delivered, delayed, in-transit)  
- Transaction amount and average utilization  
- Location, Year, Month, Truck/Asset IDs  
- Delay reasons (weather, traffic, mechanical failure)  
- Environmental data (temperature, humidity, waiting time, inventory level)

(*Replace with actual dataset link or description if available.*)

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Power BI Desktop** for data visualization and dashboard design  
- **DAX** for calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Data Modeling** for building relationships and hierarchies  

## 🔍 Methods  
1. Imported and cleaned raw logistics data in Power BI.  
2. Created KPIs for Total Shipments, On-Time Delivery %, Delayed Shipments %, Transaction Amount, and Avg Utilization.  
3. Visualized shipment status trends by month and by location.  
4. Analyzed asset utilization across multiple trucks (Asset IDs).  
5. Conducted Delay Reason Analysis (Weather, Traffic, Mechanical Failure).  
6. Integrated weather monitoring metrics (temperature, humidity, waiting time, inventory level).  
7. Designed an interactive interface with filters for Year, Month, Location, and Truck.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Monitored over **1,000 shipments** with **43.4% on-time delivery** and **56.6% delayed shipments**.  
- Tracked a transaction amount of **$299,055** with an average utilization of **80%** across trucks.  
- Identified top-performing and underperforming locations (El Paso, Dallas, Columbus, etc.).  
- Revealed primary causes of delays: Weather (31.75%), Traffic (32.02%), Mechanical Failure (36.23%).  
- Provided temperature and humidity monitoring for proactive operational planning.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project?  
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Refresh the data (if needed) and interact with the visuals.  

## 📈 Results & Conclusion  
The dashboard gives stakeholders a 360° view of logistics operations, enabling data-driven decisions to improve delivery performance, manage assets efficiently, and mitigate delay causes.

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Add predictive analytics for on-time delivery forecasting.  
- Integrate live GPS and real-time weather feeds.  
- Build automated alerts for shipment delays and asset underutilization.
